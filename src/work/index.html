    <p>TL;DR I've been a software engineer for over 20 years. Seventeen years into my career I moved into management, and it's where I still find myself today. I like communities. I cofounded the Women Who Code NYC network and co-organize BoulderJS.</p>
    <h2>Let's rewind ⏪</h2>
    <p>
      I started my career at <a href="https://www.webitects.com/">Webitects</a>, a small design firm in Chicago.
      I loved the work we got to do, so much so that I stuck around for 11 years — yes, you read that correctly.
      I had a hand in building the <a href="https://shop.artic.edu/">Art Institute of Chicago's first ecommerce site</a>,
      websites for charter schools, and annual onine survey tool for <abbr title="Chicago Public Schools">CPS</abbr> principals,
      <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/index.html">Metropolitan Planning Council</a>, and local restaurants (my original
      work is long gone). In the early days, we worked with Classic ASP and sometimes PHP, eventually migrating to ASP.NET.
    </p>
    <p>
      The designs at Webitects were always user-centric. User testing was common there even back in the early 2000s.
      I was a fullstack developer, but I most loved handcrafting the user interfaces from beautiful design mockups.
    </p>
    <h2>On to the next one…</h2>
    <p>
      During my last few years at Webitects, I moved to Boulder and then San Francisco. I found myself at <a href="https://www.blurb.com">Blurb</a>, an
      online publishing company best known for their high quality photo books. Finally, I had the opportunity to focus
      entirely on frontend development, but I also got dabble in Ruby on Rails.

    </figure>
    <p>
      My first big project at Blurb was building an online ebook editing tool. It was 2011 we
      were using EmberJS (actually, we started with Sproutcore). I focused heavily on ensuring the user experience was smooth, working not only on building
      reusable components, but also built a lightweight HTML editor from scratch.

    <p>
      My next big project was taking ownership of our new website, designed by a third-party agency. The years were
      the highlight of my career as a UI-fcoused engineer. I'd been advocating for responsive design (after reading
      <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Ethan Marcotte's book</a>) and web performance (after reading <a href="http://designingforperformance.com/">Lara Hogan's <em>Designing for Performance</em></a>), and 
      this was my opportunity to rearchitect the full frontend of our marketing website.

    <p>
      By this time I was living in New York City, became emersed in the JavaScript community, attending BrooklynJS
      (my daughter's first tech event), ManhattanJS, NYC HTML5, and Ember NYC. I was working in
      the Lower East Side with an inspiring community called <a href="https://orbital.nyc/">Orbital NYC</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cofounded my own community, Women Who Code NYC, growing that to 4000 members and up to 5 monthly events
      around the city. I am so utterly proud of this. And I am so humbled by the support we received from other event organizers in NYC; 
      organizations like DonorsChoose.org, Condé Nast, Etsy, LinkedIn, and Fog Creek; and the wonderful women that stepped up to 
      help us organize events — Brenda Deverell Cortez, Barbara Livar, Erin Zobitz, Cindy Juarez. We had events with 
      Lara Hogan, Neha Batra, Camille Fournier, Joel Spolksy, Nathalie Molina Niño — looking back, I'm amazed.
    </p>
    <p>Did I mention that I had a baby in NYC, too?</p>

    <h2>And back to Boulder ⏩</h2>
    <p>
      Back in Boulder, I got in involved with the BoulderJS meetup group. It turns out, organizing a meetup in Boulder
      is more challenging than in NYC. I landed my first Engineering Manager role at Cognizant Accelerator,
      formerly Quick Left. An opportunity opened up at <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>, and voilà, it's where I am today.
      I ❤️ Fastly.
