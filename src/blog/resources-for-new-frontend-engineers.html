    <time datetime="{{page.date}}">{% formatDate page.date %}</time>I'm fortunate to meet several
    frontend engineers that are new to the role as professionals, recent grads (mostly from code
    schools) and self-taught developers. As a result, I give a lot of tips on good habits to adopt
    and suggestions on who to follow, what to read, and what to watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I started my own career it was a different climate. Meetup didn't yet exist, events
    were scarce (with barely any women or people of color), and frontend development was not quite
    its own craft. It took me years to figure out what worked best for me to stay strong in a 
    competitive market in which I was an anomaly.

  <h2 class="article__head-secondary">My habits</h2>
  <h3>Read read read</h3>
  <p>
    When I moved to San Francisco, I lived 3 miles from my job but had a 45 minute commute.
    I used that opportunity to read one or two blog posts on frontend development a day. This is 
    the best habit I adopted by far. I grew so much as a frontend engineer and fell in love with 
    my craft.

  <h4>Who would I follow today?</h4>
  <p>I'm much more focused on management, so I'm out of date with regards to who to look to for the latest on frontend development. Most of the people I originally followed are still speaking and writing on the topic, but here some people I've come across in the past 3-4 years.</p>

  <h2 class="article__head-secondary">My favorite conference talks</h2>
  <p>Understanding what happens when a page request is initiated and how event loop works is vital to the success of any frontend engineer.</p>
