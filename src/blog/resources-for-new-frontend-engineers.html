    <time datetime="{{page.date}}">{% formatDate page.date %}</time>I'm fortunate to meet several
    frontend engineers that are new to the role as professionals, recent grads (mostly from code
    schools) and self-taught developers. As a result, I give a lot of tips on good habits to adopt
    and suggestions on who to follow, what to read, and what to watch.

    When I started my own career it was a very different climate. Meetup didn't yet exist, events
    were scarce (with barely any women or people of color), and frontend development was not quite
    its own craft. It took me years to figure out what worked best for me. This last point
    is important to note. These are tips that worked for <strong>me</strong>.

  <p>Understanding what happens when an page request is initiated and how event loop works is vital to the success of any frontend engineer.</p>
