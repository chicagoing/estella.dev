      <p>I'm an Engineering Manager. I did software development for 20+ years, primarily focused on crafting smooth user interfaces, accessiblity, and client-side performance.</p>
      <p>I love building communities. I cofounded Women Who Code NYC and currently co-organize BoulderJS.</p>

        <time datetime="{{page.date}}">{% formatDate page.date %}</time>I'm fortunate to meet several
        frontend engineers that are new to the role as professionals, recent grads (mostly from code
        schools) and self-taught developers. As a result, I give a lot of tips on good habits to adopt
        and suggestions on who to follow, what to read, and what to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I started my own career it was a different climate. Meetup didn't yet exist, events
        were scarce (with barely any women or people of color), and frontend development was not quite
        its own craft. It took me years to figure out what worked best for me to stay strong in a 
        competitive market in which I was an anomaly…

      <!-- <h3>Sustainability during a pandemic</h3>
      <p>
      You could argue sustainability needs to go on the backburner during a pandemic. In this time, I've become less fussy about organic versus conventional produce and meats — it's more about <em>find any chicken, romaine lettuce, chocolate</em>… whatever we can get our hands on.</p>
      <p>
        In this time, sustainability for me has been around reusable products — things I don't need to add to our ever growing grocery list. This list is becoming increasingly important to get right in order to limit our grocery store visits. With this in mind, I've changed some habits and more closely embraced others.
      </p>
      <p>I am, of course, writing from a very privileged perspective. I work in tech for an amazing company. I am incredibly fortunate. It hasn't always been that way for me though, and yet sustainability and reusablity have always been a priority.</p>
